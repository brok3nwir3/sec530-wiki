Bio
-----------
 
Greg Scheidel has over 25 years of hands-on experience in IT including desktop and server support, network design and implementation, application development and programming, IT service management, IT security, and information assurance. He currently leads a security program providing a full range of IT security services including SOC, incident management, risk management, penetration testing, forensic and malware analysis, cyber threat intelligence, security engineering, audit and policy SMEs. Greg firmly believes IT and security must serve business needs rather than exist for their own sake, and is passionate about teaching others while expanding and honing his own skills.

Greg holds over 30 certifications across IT, ITSM, and IT security and for his own amusement obtains certifications directly meeting every 8507.01 role (two roles to go).
